            <a class="randtext">I am Aarav Sethi, a Mount Albert Grammar School Student who takes Year Eleven Digital Technoligies Two.</a>
            <a>What is this website about you ask? This website is to display my greatness which I have achieved while studying Digital Technoligies</a>
            <a>Some of the things I have achieved, you will see on this website!</a>
            <a>Those include: Python, web-design, html/css</a>
            <a>But sadly, not all of my achievements are on this website, as if I were to list them all, this website would have fifty pages of my greatness blinding your eyes</a>
            <a>You, my friend, are lucky that I decided to hold back otherwise it would be the equivalent of staring at the sun because of my blinding achievements!</a>
            <a>Enjoy this moment while it lasts, take a look at my greatness in its true form!!!</a>
