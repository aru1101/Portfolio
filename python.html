            <a>For python, we did an assessment in which we had to create a text-based quiz on school subjects.<br> The code first asked you which subject you wanted to study and then proceded to take your input on the question and tell you whether you were right or wrong <br> It then told you your overall score of the quiz and asked you if you want to quiz again or change subject <br> That was only the assessment, outside the assesment while we were getting used to python, we made other projects <br> One of my favourite projects was the life simualor in which I made mine extremly hard to survive</a>
